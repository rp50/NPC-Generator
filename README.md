A Command-line D&D 5E NPC Generator.

### How Do I Use This?
Glad you asked! First you'll need to navigate to the [Releases Page](https://github.com/robkpaul/NPC-Generator/releases) and download the most recent version of the NPC Generator, under the assets tab of the most recent release. Find where you downloaded the `.zip` file of the most recent release, and extract it into another folder. From there, start up `NPC-Generator.exe`. From here, you can use the `help` command to see the available commands, or the `new` command to get started generating an NPC.
